package io.github.kotlinmania.unicodewidth

/**
 * Returns the code point's displayed width in columns, or `null` if the
 * code point is a control character.
 *
 * Translated from upstream `UnicodeWidthChar::width` (`impl UnicodeWidthChar for char`
 * in `src/lib.rs`). Rust's `char` is a Unicode scalar value (a 21-bit code point in the
 * range U+0000..=U+10FFFF, excluding surrogates); Kotlin's `Char` is a 16-bit UTF-16
 * code unit and cannot represent supplementary plane code points on its own. The
 * receiver is therefore [Int], interpreted as a Unicode scalar value, so callers can
 * pass any code point in the same range Rust accepts.
 *
 * This function treats characters in the Ambiguous category according
 * to [Unicode Standard Annex #11](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/)
 * as 1 column wide. This is consistent with the recommendations for non-CJK
 * contexts, or when the context cannot be reliably determined.
